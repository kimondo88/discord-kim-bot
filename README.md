# discord-kim-bot

canvas has strict dependencies, advisable before using npm i, 

check https://discordjs.guide/popular-topics/canvas.html before using the bot on your server. 

There is no build script yet for production, so canvas - $obraz command will not work without prerequisities. 

API key for openweather is also not public.
